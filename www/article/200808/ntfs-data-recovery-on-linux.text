NTFS data recovery on Linux

Summary: Aargh!  A broken NTFS filesystem, and recovering it on Linux.

My Dad's PC hard disk died at the weekend.  Well, as far as I can tell, the hard disk is
fine, but the boot sector and master file table of the NTFS filesystem on it are broken.
Windows doesn't recognise it as an NTFS file system.

As my main PC is now an Ubuntu Linux box, I'm in a bit of trouble recovering the data.
Certainly the NTFS file system drivers for Linux have as much trouble as Windows in
recognising the data.

After an awful lot of playing with `dd` and Googling about, I found that the boot sector
of the partition had been hosed.  Luckily, there's a backup copy of the boot sector.
Some [documentation][backup] says it's at the end of the partition, but I found it at
the centre.  A bit of [bash shell maths][malc] later and I had the bootsector `dd`ed
out.

I transplanted the backup back in the first sector of the disk...and...the NTFS drivers
recognise it as an NTFS partition!  Yay!  But boo...the MFT is corrupt.  I tried
`CHKDSK` on Windows, but that says the same thing.  Even though there's supposedly a backup to the
MFT on the disk somewhere too (I've yet to find it).

Latterly I found [Scrounge NTFS][scrounge], which compiled cleanly, and was able to read the MFT, and some file data too.

However, it doesn't seem to work 100% reliably.  It faulted out halfway through (on the `PAGEFILE.SYS` on the
drive).  Additionally, it doesn't support compressed files.

Looks like I _should_ be able to coerce it into working though, with a bit of hackery.  But first I need to
get some spare disk space to try it out in.  I'll post if and when I get the data off...and whether I have
to resort to some payware Windows tools in the end!
