Summary: Some notes on Compiler Explorer's new storage
Label: Coding

Hello! As of today's update, [Compiler Explorer][ce] now has its own storage solution
for when you click "Share" and pick "Short" from the dropdown. We used to store
all the state in the URL itself, then we used goo.gl to shorten it. When Stack
Overflow banned goo.gl, we rewrote goo.gl URLs to be godbolt.org/g/blah, where
blah was the bit from goo.gl. So, your data was still stored with Google.

That's all changed! Now short URLs are derived from data stored on the Compiler
Explorer website itself. This has some very important changes:

* You'll get a new Privacy Policy to agree to: we changed the policy to be clear
  that we will now store your data if you shorten links.
* The limit on URL length which previously prevented some longer code snippets
  or more complex layouts from being shortened is now lifted. There's no
  practical limit any more: though we might pragmatically have to put one in.
* The short link unfurling that happens when you paste a link into Slack,
  Discord, or Twitter is much improved.
* Compiler Explorer admins are now responsible for your data. We understand
  this is a huge responsibility and take it very seriously. We have a number
  of safeguards in place to keep everything as safe and secure as we can.

If you have _any_ issues with the new system please get in contact as soon as
possible. You can [email][] me, or [tweet][] at me, or direct message me on the
[Cpplang Slack][slack].

Over the next few weeks we hope to augment this system with further
improvements. Watch this space!

As ever, huge thanks to Compiler Explorer's main developer, Rub√©n Rincon!
