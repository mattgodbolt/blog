Summary: An excellent description of the challenges faced by the Human Genome Project.  And some miscellaneous other bits.

My friend [Thomas][] pointed me in the direction of this excellent comment on the Human Genome Project
(from [challenges in the Human Genome Project][umdnj]):

> Consider the 3.3 gigabytes of a human genome as equivalent to 3.3 gigabytes of files on
the mass-storage device of some computer system of unknown design. Obtaining the sequence
is equivalent to obtaining an image of the contents of that mass-storage device.
Understanding the sequence is equivalent to reverse engineering that unknown computer system
(both the hardware and the 3.3 gigabytes of software) all the way back to a full set of design
and maintenance specifications.

> Reverse engineering the sequence is complicated by the fact that the resulting image of the
mass-storage device will not be a file-by-file copy, but rather a streaming dump of the bytes
in the order they occupied on the device and the files are known to be fragmented.
In addition, some of the device is known to contain erased files or other garbage. Once the garbage
has been recognized and discarded and the fragmented files reassembled, the reverse engineering of
the codes must be undertaken with only a partial, and sometimes incorrect understanding of the CPU
on which the codes run. In fact, deducing the structure and function of the CPU is part of the
project, since some of the 3.3 gigabytes are known to be the binary specifications for the
computer-assisted-manufacturing process that fabricates the CPU. In addition, one must also
consider that the huge database also contains code generated from the result of literally
millions of maintenance revisions performed by the worst possible set of kludge-using,
spaghetti-coding, opportunistic hackers who delight in clever tricks like writing self-modifying
code and relying upon undocumented system quirks.

Absolutely spot on.

Totally unrelated, but by far the best "wow factor" link I've had in ages, have a look at what
can be done with [a single sheet of A4 paper][paper].

Finally, I've found a little free clipboard tool which really ought to be built into windows ---
persistent multiple clipboard entries of all types.  Have a look at [clipx][]; you won't be
disappointed.
