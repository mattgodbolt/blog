Launching a debugger automatically

Summary: Automatically launching the debugger for a particular executable.

I'm spending a fair amount of time [debugging][prev] at the moment.
The particular application I'm looking at is a suite of related server processes which
spawn each other and are very multithreaded.

I've been looking for was a way of
getting my debugger "in" right at the start of the one of the servers, even when it was
launched by another server process.  Ideally, I'd just put a `DebugBreak()` somewhere at the beginning of the server, and use JIT
debugging to attach at that point.

Unfortunately, for some reason that wasn't working; by the
time the debugger had attached, the call stack was out in the uncaught exception handling code.
Not very useful.

After some searching around, I found something in Windows I'd never heard of before, which I
thought might be the perfect thing.  Apparently, with the right registry keys, you can make
Windows automatically debug a given executable.  The details are on [MSDN][launch].

This seemed like a perfect solution.  Whenever the server is run, the debugger is launched
with the parameters to debug the executable.  However, a fresh new IDE is started every time,
and the process isn't started automatically.

By the time I've started the process myself --- annoyingly forcing a save of the solution file, with all
the attendant dialogs that requires --- the server which spawned the process has timed it out and started another copy.
That timeout, coupled with the plethora of new IDEs popping up everywhere made this approach unusable.

In the end I rolled my own solution, querying the [relevant registry key][regkey]
myself, launching the JIT debugger in code and then awaiting its attachment using `IsDebuggerPresent()`.
