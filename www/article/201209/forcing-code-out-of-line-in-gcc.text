Summary: A way of ensuring non-hot code is taken out of line in GCC, using C++11 lambdas
Label: Coding

Have you ever wanted to force some code completely out of line?  Maybe some 
rare case or exception that really you don't give a heck about when on your 
hot path, but still sits there and pollutes your instruction cache?

You have? 

Boy is it your lucky day today!

Before:

    ::: cpp
    void test() {
       // do stuff here, update failure
       if (failed) {
         // Not only is this unlikely, but I don't
         // want this code polluting the i-cache.
        cout << "Oh no!" << endl;
      }
    }

After:

    ::: cpp
    void test() {
       // do stuff here, update failure
       if (failed) {
        [&]() __attribute__(noinline,cold) {
            cout << "Oh no!" << endl;
        }();
      }
    }


Basically, define a C++11 lambda function, mark it as cold and non-inlineable, then execute it immediately.  A function being "cold" makes GCC treat the code as "don't predict a branch to this", makes it optimized for size instead of speed, and also places it in a section that gets linked away from "hot" code.

Cute trick, eh?
