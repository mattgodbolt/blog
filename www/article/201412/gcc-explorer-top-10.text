GCC Explorer's top 10 compilers

Summary: Wondering which compilers I can retire from GCC Explorer
Label: Coding

I've had a post-it note on my computer for the over six months to upgrade the
 [GCC Explorer](http://gcc.godbolt.org) cluster to Ubuntu 14.04 from its
current 12.04 setup. One issue I have is that newer
 [Clang](http://clang.llvm.org) versions only
have pre-canned binaries for 14.04, and rather than have to build my own, I'd
prefer to use those binaries.

That being said; the reverse is true for older compilers like [GCC
4.4](http://gcc.gnu.org).

I wondered if I could drop support for GCC 4.4, and in short, I don't think I
can!  I turned to the very minimal Google Analytics I have for GCC Explorer,
and the top ten compilers (in nearly 2 million compiles) are:

1. clang++ 3.0.6 (the default when you visit the site) -- 37%
2. g++ 4.8 -- 15%
3. g++ 4.9 -- 13%
4. clang++ 3.4.1 -- 6%
5. g++ 4.9 concepts branch -- 4%
6. clang++ 3.3 -- 4%
7. g++ 4.7 -- 4%
8. Intel's compiler 13.0.1 -- 3%
9. ARM g++ 4.6 -- 2%
10. g++- 4.4 -- 2%

So, venerable old g++ 4.4 is still getting 2% of the hits to the site (40,000
compiles).

I suppose I'll have to bite the bullet and get builds of gcc4.4 for Ubuntu
14.04. I also really ought to update the Intel compiler too!
