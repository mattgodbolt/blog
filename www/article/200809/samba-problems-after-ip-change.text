[Samba][] is great, but is a real pain to configure, and very hard to diagnose problems.  There's
plenty of log information to plough through once you've remembered how to enable it, but whenever
I find myself having to change anything about my setup, I'll spend at least a couple of hours
scratching my head wondering what on earth is going on.  In the interest of saving somebody else
from this pain...if you find yourself banging your head against a wall primary domain controller (PDC)
having weird symptoms like:

[samba]: http://www.samba.org/ "brilliant; but awkward to configure"

* Long hangs in Windows when browsing the domain.
* Logins fail intermittently.
* Trying to joining a machine to the domain fails with the error "domain unavailable" even though the domain
  is definitely there.

And you see errors in `log.nmbd` of the form:

    domain_master_node_status_fail:
    Doing a node status request to the domain master browser
    for workgroup PROFACTOR at IP 192.168.200.220 failed.
    Cannot sync browser lists.

...then there might be a simple explanation.  If you've recently changed your server's IP address, there are
a number of places where the old IP will still be lurking, possibly causing the issues above.

`nmbd` caches browse master information in `/var/cache/samba/browse.dat` --- your PDC's old IP
address will be listed here, and when `nmbd` starts up, it sees it as an existing, distinct
domain master browser that then doesn't respond to it any more.   Stop `nmbd` and then delete the
file.

In a similar way the WINS resolution system caches IPs --- delete `/var/lib/samba/wins.dat`.

Restart the samba servers, and hopefully all will be well.
