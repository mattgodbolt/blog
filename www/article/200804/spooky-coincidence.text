I've just spotted a [very spooky coincidence][spooky].  Not only is there another Matt Godbolt
about in the world, he married a Vanessa too!

Anyway, I'm off for a couple of weeks to Cyprus for the last
(sane) holiday before Baby G makes his or her grand entrance.  We're really
looking forward to a bit of sunshine and relaxation, and I'm looking forward
to tinkering a bit on my code projects.  I might even get a chance to look at
the [Weebox][wb] again!  I'm feeling more inspired to finish after hearing about a
friend's rather interesting [hardware 6502 emulator][pipes] in the pub this week.
