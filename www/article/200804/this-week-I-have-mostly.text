This week, I have mostly been...

Summary: The worst kind of blog post - a generic update.

When I restarted my blogging a few months ago my intention was to not just post random little
snippets of "what I've been doing recently".  Well, the road to hell is paved by good intentions[*][star]
so here's my first general, rather boring dump:

[star]: #star "See below"

* Ness is now 26 weeks pregnant, and is blooming.  We're still so very excited about becoming parents.
Decent names still elude us, but we're hoping to think up some semi-decent ones soon.  I'm starting to
idly wonder what my kids will make of all this in years to come --- assuming [archive.org][] still keeps
a copy of all this in fifteen years' time.
* [Google app engine][gae] --- looks to be the best toolkit going, combining all the convenience
of a [TurboGears][]-like environment with the backing of Google's scalability technology.  Have spent
a couple of evenings mucking about with it (using Malc's [OSJam][] stuff as a starting point), and
can't really fault it.  Well, ok, I'd prefer a more [Kid][]-like template system by default, but there's
nothing to stop me from using Kid with App Engine.
* [What Every Programmer Should Know About Memory][mem] --- nuff said.
* Mark Russinovich's "[The Case of the Unexplained...][russ]" --- how to debug your PC when it misbehaves.
Or perhaps more likely, how to find the suspicious virus-like program on your Dad's PC that he
claims he never installed.

[TurboGears]: http://turbogears.org "Cool Python web toolkit"
[OSJam]: http://www.farside.org.uk/200804/hosting_jam
[kid]: http://turbogears.org/about/kid.html "IMO the best-looking HTML template system around"
[mem]: http://people.redhat.com/drepper/cpumemory.pdf "If you code; read it.  Or at least skim it.  A bit"
[russ]: http://www.microsoft.com/emea/spotlight/sessionh.aspx?videoid=722 "Never again will you say 'Why is my PC booting so slowly'"
[PKR]: http://www.pkr.com "Online Poker - evolved"

Work's going well, the last few months I've been consulting for [PKR][], which is good fun.  Lots of
SQL nonsense, with a splash of C++ and Python for good measure.

That's about it really.  I told you it was boring, didn't I?
