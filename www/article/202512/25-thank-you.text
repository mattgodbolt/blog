Summary: The end of the 2025 Advent of Compiler Optimisation
Label: Coding, AoCO2025

<p class="ai-disclaimer">Written by me, proof-read by an LLM.
<br/>Details at end.</p>It's the 25th! Whatever you celebrate this time of year, I wish you the very best and hope you are having a lovely day. For me, this is a family time: I'm not at all religious but was brought up to celebrate Christmas. So, today we'll be cooking a massive roast dinner and enjoying family time[^teenage].

[^teenage]: As much as our teenage children will tolerate, anyway.

This series was an idea I had around this time last year, and it has been a substantial amount of work. I've really enjoyed writing it, and seeing the impact it has had on the compiled language community. I realise now in retrospect I exclusively used C and C++[^rust], and concentrated on x86 a bit too much. If I do this again, I'll try and widen my horizons!

[^rust]: In my notes I had at least a couple of Rust ideas, but never got around to them.

Speaking of doing it again, I have a number of half-researched, half-written ideas that didn't make the cut. I may either write a few more non-advent posts exploring them, or keep them for another year. Right now I can't promise anything: most of the work for this series was done while I was between jobs, and now I am [working full time](https://www.hudsonrivertrading.com/) I don't know if I'll be able to do this again. Despite the low-budget look of the videos, and the shortness of the posts, it has been a pretty phenomenal amount of work. I don't know how regular content creators do it! I may post a follow-up on "the making of AoCO", and go into some details of how I approached this series.

I'd like to thank a number of people:

- [Jason Turner](https://articles.emptycrate.com) for some ideas, feedback and for being such a proponent of Compiler Explorer over the years.
- [Malcolm Rowe](https://www.farside.org.uk/) for his review and encouragement.
- [Laurie Kirk](https://www.youtube.com/@lauriewired) for her help and detailed instructions on getting a decent video setup and editing workflow.
- [Sean Riley](https://bsky.app/profile/seanski44.bsky.social) for invaluable video editing tutoring.
- [Colin Hoad](https://www.colinhoad.com/) whose "Advent of Beeb" videos were the inspiration for this series.
- All the folks who work on compilers: GCC, clang, MSVC and the many others. I really only dug into GCC and clang, but without the hard work of compiler maintainers, this series wouldn't exist.
- All of Compiler Explorer's Patrons ([join them here](https://patreon.com/c/mattgodbolt)), GitHub sponsors ([join them here](https://github.com/sponsors/compiler-explorer)), and in particular Greg Barker for his ideas.
- The [Compiler Explorer Team](https://github.com/orgs/compiler-explorer/people) - a group of lovely people who very kindly give up their time to help administrate the site, triage and fix bugs, and add new features. Without them, Compiler Explorer wouldn't be a tenth of the site it is now.
- And of course, my wonderful wife, Ness, for her support over the last few months as I routinely ignored her to write articles and record and edit videos. Thank you - I love you so very much.

And of course, thank **you** for joining me on this journey. Compilers are amazing: truly one of the quiet modern miracles that makes the modern world possible!
