Summary: Seeding Google with a post about a friend's mobile cocktail bar.
Label: Blog

As a Google employee, I'm always being asked how to get websites higher up on
the search results page. I really don't know any more than the average person, but as
far as I can tell, there's really no secret to it --- have an interesting
website that contains useful, easy to read information, and you're well on the
way.

However, you need incoming links. Of course, a good website will pick up links
as people discover it, but there's a kind of [boot-strapping][boot] problem to
that. A friend has set up a new business, and has exactly this problem, so this
is a bit of an excuse of a post to help him out.
