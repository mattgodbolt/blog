All change for me

Summary: Big news, I've left DRW, have some spare time, and a new job in the summer
Label: Blog

Last week I took the momentous decision to wave goodbye to my
friends and colleagues at [DRW](https://drw.com/), and try something new.

I had an amazing 7Â½ years at DRW, learning so much and making some firm friends. DRW is an
excellent company to work for, and this was the longest job I'd ever had. That made the decision to
leave extremely hard, but I felt it was time to try something new.

I'm taking a few months off, and then I'm very excited to start work at [Coinbase](https://coinbase.com)
in the summer, where I will be working on making their exchange software even more awesome.
I'll be staying in the Chicago area, so disruption to my family is minimal.

In the next few weeks I'll be spending a lot of time with my wife and kids, but I also hope to use
the time to
work on [Compiler Explorer][ce] and other [open][zindex] [source][seasocks]
[projects][jsbeeb]. And finally complete Zelda: Breath of the Wild too!
