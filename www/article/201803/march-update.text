Label: Coding, Compiler Explorer

Compiler Explorer now has a logo!

<p class="picture">

 alt="Compiler Explorer"/>
</a>

If you like it and want to support Compiler Explorer, I set up an
[online shop](https://shop.spreadshirt.com/compiler-explorer/) where you can
create your own T shirts, bags, mugs and so on! By doing so you're supporting
Compiler Explorer's development, as I get a small commission for any sales. Of
course, it's all open source, so you can make your own with the logo too!

In other news, since last month I've uploaded a few more videos:

* [Miracle - a JavaScript Sega Master System emulator][miracle]. Another emulation talk,
  this time on a games console.
* [Performance Tuning][perf]. A worked example of tuning performance for a latency-sensitive
  application, similar to the kinds of things I do in my day job.
* [Wolfenstein 3D's map renderer][wolf]. A short explanation of the main "trick" used to get
  this amazing 1992 classic game working on the hardware of the day.
* [Seasocks - a C++ embeddable WebSockets server][seasocks]. A lightning talk on my [open source][ss]
  web server project.
