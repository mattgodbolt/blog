Summary: Some stats on emulated images
Label: Emulation

A quick one this. Last night while I ought to be doing more
 [micro-architecture research][ma] I was instead reading the Wikipedia
article on [Beebdroid][bd].

[ma]: /Microarchitecture-archive
[bd]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beebdroid "A fab emulator by my pal Reuben"

I noticed it had the top 20 played games...and I thought I'd do the same for
 [jsbeeb](https://bbc.xania.org/).

So for the period 1st January 2015 to 16th February 2016, the top 20 disc images
loaded from the "Stairway to Hell" archive are:

| Image | Number of loads | Percentage |
|-------|:---------------:|:----------:|
| 10OfTheBestGames | 374 | 4.00% |
| Elite | 318 | 3.40% |
| 2002 | 192 | 2.06% |
| Airwolf | 128 | 1.37% |
| 3DPool | 123 | 1.32% |
| Exile | 117 | 1.25% |
| Elite-v1.0_B | 111 | 1.19% |
| 3DBombAlley | 101 | 1.08% |
| Elite-MasterAndTubeEnhanced | 99 | 1.06% |
| Arcadians | 84 | 0.90% |
| ChuckieEgg | 84 | 0.90% |
| 180Darts | 82 | 0.88% |
| Repton | 81 | 0.87% |
| 3DGrandPrix | 78 | 0.83% |
| Frak | 72 | 0.77% |
| 10OfTheBestEducation_B | 72 | 0.77% |
| 3DConvoy | 68 | 0.73% |
| Pacman | 67 | 0.72% |
| CastleQuest | 65 | 0.70% |
| 1984 | 61 | 0.65% |

Interesting, eh? I can only guess "100OfTheBestGames" and "2002" are so
popular because they appear near the top of the image picker dialog if
you don't filter it.

For what it's worth this doesn't include all the hits to the built-in Elite
image. That numbers 8,500 hits over the same period.
