Google POP3 certificate problem and Thunderbird

Summary: A temporary issue with Google's SSL certificates, and a workaround.
Label: Blog
Status: Public

Last night I noticed my hosted Google mail accounts filling up with messages.  Usually
my email client at work drains all the new messages into its inbox, meaning my web account
empties as quickly as messages come in.
When I got into the office this morning I found it was [Thunderbird][] complaining of a certificate problem ---
Thunderbird was connecting to pop.googlemail.com but getting an expired certificate
from cpop.corp.google.com.

[thunderbird]: http://www.thunderbird.org "Reclaim your inbox...from what?"

Working together with Malcolm, we were able to track this down to an
issue where the servers report the wrong certificate, if and only if there's a [TLS][]
`server_name` extension in the initial handshake packet.  Only Thunderbird seems to
send this; viewing the port via [curl][] or Internet Explorer didn't have the issue.
Thanks to [Wireshark][] for the tip-off.  A build of the latest [OpenSSL][] shows this up:

[curl]: http://curl.haxx.se/ "groks those URLs, apparently"
[Wireshark]: http://www.wireshark.org/ "Go deep into your packets"
[openssl]: http://www.openssl.org/ "Open, SSLme"
[TLS]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security "Transport Layer Security"

    openssl s_client -msg -debug \
            -servername pop.googlemail.com -tlsextdebug \
            -connect 66.249.93.16:995

Malcolm's reported a bug to Google, and we're hoping it's a quick fix.  In the meantime,
there's a workaround for Thunderbird.  If you go to Tools->Options, then the Advanced page
and click the "Config Editor", you can disable TLS (and therefore the TLS extension).  Type
"tls" into the box and uncheck the "security.enable_tls" option.

Hopefully it'll be fixed soon!

**Update** 4pm : this issue is now confirmed fixed by Google.  Quick work there!
