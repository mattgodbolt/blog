Compiling MPPE support into debian

After a powercut, I had to rebuild my kernel --- I needed MPPE support for VPN,
and I have here a collection of handy links.

Yup, something which took me the best part of three days the first time to get
working now has a fair set of useful links.

* Visit Adam Hooper's [setup guide][adamhooper] to prepare a patched kernel (I used 2.6.10 with no ill effect).
* The official pptpclient page also has [debian MPPE patch][pptpclient] instructions,
  though I found them a bit more wordy than I would have liked.
* A godsend, the [fault tree][pptpdiagnosis] on the pptpclient page.

[pptpclient]: http://pptpclient.sourceforge.net/howto-debian-build.phtml "pptpclient debian MPPE patch"
[pptpdiagnosis]: http://pptpclient.sourceforge.net/howto-diagnosis.phtml "pptp fault tree"

The main thing that gets me is the ridiculously over-complicated make-kpkg part.  I'm so used
to just rolling my own kernels I never did quite get with the debian 'helpful'
tool to do it.  But, when in Rome...

I ended up using this:

    make-kpkg --added-patches mppe --append-to-version mppe --config menuconfig configure
    make-kpkg --added-patches mppe --append-to-version mppe --config menuconfig kernel_image

For those lost in the mess of kernel configs, the main ones to worry about are
in Device Drivers/Networking support then scroll to PPP.

I'm now back with a working MPPE VPN setup, and in no time at all!
