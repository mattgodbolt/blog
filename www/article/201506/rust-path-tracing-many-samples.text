What abuse of compute resources looks like

Summary: What happens if you use work's computer resources
Label: Coding, Rust

With the partial image and seeding support in my [Rust path tracer][rpt], I
was finally able to do what I had hoped...use some idle time on my work
computers to render a "proper" number of samples.

Well, there you go then!

Took just over an hour broken up into 1,000 jobs running at idle priority on
work's compute cluster.

Once I've finished stylistic tweaks to the Rust code, I'll put in explicit light
tracing, which will speed it up considerably. Then I can start doing samples
in the spectral space as well as the time and focus space, and get some really
cool results, such as [Michael Fogleman][mf]'s [awesome Go path tracer][gpt].
