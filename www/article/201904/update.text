Summary: Some notes on Compiler Explorer's new storage
Label: Blog

Hello friends.

A quick note on a big change: the office I worked at was closed on Tuesday and I was let go. All
is well: my team and I were well-treated and I have plenty of opportunities to investigate.

This does mean I have some spare time, and even once I get a new job I plan on spending all of May
working on Compiler Explorer, and on finishing off my video series.
