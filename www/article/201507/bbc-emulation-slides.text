Summary: Slides on how to emulate a BBC Microcomputer in Javascript
Label: Emulation

Last year I gave a presentation at work on my favourite open source project,
[jsbeeb](https://bbc.xania.org/) -- "Emulating a BBC Micro in Javascript".

The slides are [now available online][slides]. Hopefully they
make enough sense by themselves to be interesting. Please note that you can go
both left/right and up/down: Some slides have more information if you go down.

The slides were made using [reveal](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/) with a
bit of custom work to get the 6502 assembly syntax highlighted.

Update: I've just been given permission to release [the
video](/201507/bbc-emulation-video).
