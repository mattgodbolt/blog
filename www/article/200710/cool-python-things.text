Things I didn't know about Python, part 1

My favourite scripting language by far is [Python][].  I'm always finding cool things
in the language that I didn't know were there.  Even though I've been writing scripts
in it for years, today I discovered that you can use maths-style ranges in comparisons.

[python]: http://www.python.org "Python - my favourite scripting language"

Whereas in most languages to check a value `x` is within a range (say, 5 or more but less than 20),
you might do:

    // In C:
    if (x >= 5 && x < 20) { ... code ... }

    # In Python (without using the cool thing)
    if x >= 5 and x < 20: # code

In Python, you can write the more mathsy:

    if 5 <= x < 20: # code

Just a little thing I never realised.
