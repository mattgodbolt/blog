Summary: How to get 6502 CPU timings just right when emulating
Label: Coding, Emulation

This is the third post in my series on emulating a BBC Micro in Javascript. You
might find it instructive to read the [first part][fp] which covers general
stuff, or the [second part][sp] which focuses on the video hardware. This post
will cover the subtleties of the 6502's instruction timings. In the next post
I'll cover how interrupts and hardware timers fit into the mix.

This time around the thanks really have to go to my good chum Rich
Talbot-Watkins. He and I have been friends since we were twelve years old and
have been programming together since we met. His knowledge of the Beeb is
legendary --- he still [writes][demo1] [games][demo2] for it even now. His help in
getting the timings spot on in [jsbeeb][jsbeeb] was invaluable.

Why is timing so important anyway?
----------------------------------

Getting the instruction timings right is paramount for good emulation. I
covered some of this in the [first post][fp], but so many tricks on the BBC
required intimate knowledge of the instruction and hardware timings that if an
emulator didn't account for them properly, some things wouldn't work right.

The most challenging example of timings were games protection systems. 
These would be used to prevent disassembly, copying and cheats.
The game code would be encrypted first and would be decrypted at runtime by
code. The code would often use XORs with hardware timers (amongst other things) to make it
difficult to decrypt manually. In order to decrypt correctly the relative timing 
of the decryption code and the hardware timers has to be emulated absolutely
perfectly.

Worse still, it's not just how many CPU cycles each instruction takes that
needs to be correct, but the fact that the memory reads and writes happen on
particular cycles within an instruction that need to be correct. 

Let's delve a little into that:

Life of an instruction
----------------------

The 6502 at the heart of the Beeb is simple but powerful. Like most other
processors, instructions are fetched from RAM and executed in turn. The 6502
has a very simple pipeline --- the fetch for the next instruction happens 
during the execution of the previous instruction. This has important
consequences that we'll talk about later.

Most CPUs have a physical pin dedicated to indicate "I need to access memory", but 
to save costs this was left off of the 6502. Instead the memory system is
permanently engaged. As almost every clock cycle needs 
access to memory (to read instructions or data) this is generally a win.
Again, this is an important fact which leads to some unusual behaviour we must
account for.

The 6502 treats the 256 bytes at the bottom of RAM (the "zero
page") specially. Instructions accessing the zero page are encoded differently
and run a little faster (as they don't need to encode two address bytes). 
The zero page can also be treated as an array of 16-bit index pointers. 

Let's go through a quick example, calculating a very simple checksum over ten
bytes:

    :::asm
    .checksum        ; Sum 10 bytes pointed by $70/$71
        LDA #0       ; Set A (our checksum) to zero
        TAY          ; Also put zero in Y (the loop counter)
    .lp
        CLC          ; Clear carry (all adds are with carry)
        ADC ($70), Y ; Add check sum
        INY          ; Y++
        CPY #10      ; is Y 10?
        BNE lp       ; if not, loop around
        RTS          ; we're done, result in A

This example assembles to the 12 bytes:

    a9 00 a8 18 71 70 c8 c0 0a d0 f8 60

Using [Visual 6502][v6502-1], we can see what memory accesses happen on each clock tick:

[v6502-1]: http://www.visual6502.org/JSSim/expert.html?a=0&d=a900a8187170c8c00ad0f860

    :::asm
      #  addr  data rw Comment
      0 $0000  $a9   1  LDA #
      1 $0001  $00   1  #0
      2 $0002  $a8   1  TAY
      3 $0003  $18   1  (CLC)
      4 $0003  $18   1  CLC
      5 $0004  $71   1  (ADC)
      6 $0004  $71   1  ADC (zp),Y
      7 $0005  $70   1  $70
      8 $0070  $00   1  addrLo
      9 $0071  $00   1  addrHi
     10 $0000  $a9   1  val at (addr)
     11 $0006  $c8   1  INY
     12 $0007  $c0   1  (CPY) 
     13 $0007  $c0   1  CPY #
     14 $0008  $0a   1  #10 
     15 $0009  $d0   1  BNE
     16 $000a  $f8   1  lp
     17 $000b  $60   1  (RTS)
     18 $0003  $18   1  CLC

Here the columns indicate the cycle number; the value output on the physical
address bus (`addr`); the data on the data bus (`data`); the value on the
"read not write" pin (`rw`), where a `1` indicates a read access, and a `0`
indicates a write; and then a comment explaining a little of what's going on
that cycle.

As you can see the memory is accessed unconditionally on every cycle. Points
to note:

On cycles 3, 12 and 17 the opcode following the current instruction is
fetched prematurely. In the case of cycles 3 and 12, the instruction is a
single byte instruction. Each instruction takes a minimum of two clock cycles,
and in this case the following instruction is fetched twice. In the case of 
cycle 17, the next instruction is fetched even though the branch isn't taken.

The sequence of fetches for the `ADC ($70), Y` instruction is `opcode`, `zero page
address`, `zero page low`, `zero page high` (the low and high together give
a 16-bit address), and finally `address pointed to plus Y`.

So far so good - it seems unusual to our modern "memory is slow" mindset that
the processor touches RAM every cycle, but this is from an age where
processors and RAM were clocked at the same speed.

Now let's get a little more interesting. Let's set the address pointed to by
`$70`/`$71` to be `$0eff` and take a look at what happens for `Y=0` and `Y=1`,
where we'd expect `$0eff+0 = $0eff` and `$0eff+1 = $0d00` to be read from.

First, here's `Y=0`:

    :::asm
      #  addr  data rw Comment
      6 $0004  $71  1  ADC (zp),Y
      7 $0005  $70  1  $70
      8 $0070  $ff  1  addrLo=$ff
      9 $0071  $0e  1  addrHi=$0e
     10 $0eff  $00  1  val at $0eff

Nothing shocking there. Now take a look at the next iteration where `Y=1`:

    :::asm
      #  addr  data rw Comment
     20 $0004  $71  1  ADC (zp),Y
     21 $0005  $70  1  $70 
     22 $0070  $ff  1  addrLo=$ff
     23 $0071  $0e  1  addrHi=$0e
     24 $0e00  $00  1  val at $0e00 ?!
     25 $0f00  $00  1  val at $0f00

Whoah --- what's all that? On cycle 24, we fetch the byte at `$0e00` which is
not the right address at all. Then there's an extra cycle where we read from
the correct place.

The 6502 is an 8-bit machine and so adding an 8-bit offset to a 16-bit address
ought to take two cycles: one to add the low bits together, and then one to
add any carry to the high bits. As the address bus is always active, the
non-carried address is output on the first cycle. If there's no carry, the
6502 stops there, else it does another read, this time with the correct
address. Neat, eh?

Things aren't always that simple, however. For instructions that both read
_and_ write, the double-read always happens. For example, the instruction `INC
$1234,X` will always do two reads and one write, even if there's no carry.
This is because even if there's no carry to do, there's still work to be done
waiting for the increment operation to finish before the final result can be
stored. There's nothing to short-cut. What's more, the increment operation
takes a while longer and the write happens twice; once with the unmodified
value, and once with the correct value. This is what it looks like, when there's
no carry (for `INC $3412,X` with `X=0`):

    :::asm
      #  addr  data rw Comment
      2 $0002  $fe  1  INC Abs,X
      3 $0003  $12  1  addrLo=$12
      4 $0004  $34  1  addrHi=$34
      5 $3412  $00  1  read $3412 (and get 0)
      6 $3412  $00  1  read $3412 again
      7 $3412  $00  0  write back 0
      8 $3412  $01  0  write back 1

And when there's a carry (`INC $3412,X` with `X=$FF`):

    :::asm
      #  addr  data rw Comment
      2 $0002  $fe  1  INC Abs,X
      3 $0003  $12  1  addrLo=$12
      4 $0004  $34  1  addrHi=$34
      5 $3411  $00  1  read $3411 (non-carry addr)
      6 $3511  $00  1  read $3511 (correct addr)
      7 $3511  $00  0  write back 0
      8 $3511  $01  0  write back 1

Wait around for ages and then two turn up at once
-------------------------------------------------

Just when you thought all this was making sense, there's another thing to
consider. Inside the Beeb there are two buses. Fast peripherals and RAM
can run at the same speed as the CPU itself and are clocked at 2MHz. Some of
the peripherals can't work at this blazing speed, and instead need to be
communicated with at the slothly 1MHz. These peripherals are memory mapped and
the Beeb supports this variable speed memory access with a bit of help of some 
external circuitry which looks at the memory addresses on the bus and slows
the CPU clock down when accessing areas of memory where slow peripherals are
mapped. The gory details are mostly covered in the [BBC Micro hardware guide][hwg],
but the main thing we need to worry about is how our CPU clock gets synchronized up and
cycle-stretched to talk to the 1MHz bus.

[hwg]: http://bbc.nvg.org/doc/A%20Hardware%20Guide%20for%20the%20BBC%20Microcomputer/bbc_hw_03.htm#3.3

There are two possible cases --- one where the bus access starts in the middle
of a 2MHz pulse, and one where they coincide.

<script src="/media/wavedrom/default.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="/media/wavedrom/WaveDrom.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
window.onload = function(){ WaveDrom.ProcessAll(); };
</script>

<div>
<script type="WaveDrom">
{ signal : [
  { name: "2 MHz",  wave: "N......." },
  { name: "1 MHz",  wave: "N...", period: 2 },
  {                 node: "..A.B...", phase: 0.5 },
  { name: "Case 1", wave: "N.h.N..." },
  {                 node: "...CD...", phase: 0.5 },
  { name: "Case 2", wave: "N..hN..." }
],
edge: ['A-&gt;B stretch', 'C-&gt;D stretch']}
</script>
</div>

Most of the interesting things happen on the falling edge of the clock
(although the 6502 does some things on the rising edge too). That means that
depending on whether we're on an odd or even cycle relative to the 1MHz timer
we'll get cycle stretched to either 2 or 3 cycles. And of course, each time
the processor accesses memory, it may get stretched. So, putting this together
with the previous section on all the extra accesses that happen, you can see
that an instruction modifying the memory on a 1MHz peripheral can take many
more cycles than it would otherwise seem to need.

Let's take a specific example, from the legendary [Kevin Edwards'][ke]
 [Nightshade][ns]
protection. Here, Kevin uses a read-modify-write instruction on a 1MHz-bus
attached timer register at `$fe48`. This register is the low 8 bits of a
16-bit timer that counts down at 1MHz. Writing to the register replaces the
bottom 8 bits with the written value (which then continues counting down at
1MHz). Here the read-modify-write instruction is a rotate left, which suffers
from the same double-write behaviour as the `DEC` instruction from the
previous section.

[ns]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightshade_(1985_video_game)
[ke]: http://www.stairwaytohell.com/authors/kedwards/PRO-KEdwards.html

    :::asm
      #  addr  data rw Comment
      0 $0d2d  $2e  1  ROL abs
      1 $0d2e  $48  1  addrLo=$48
      2 $0d2f  $fe  1  addrHi=$fe
      3 $fe48  $00  1  read...
      4 $fe48  $00  1  ..stretch..
      5 $fe48  $08  1  ..read complete
      6 $fe48  $08  0  write unmodified..
      7 $fe48  $08  0  ..stretch..complete
      8 $fe48  $10  0  write modified..
      9 $fe48  $10  0  ..stretch..complete

Unlike the previous examples, this one is not generated by Visual 6502 but is
hand-calculated, and shows what happens on each 2MHz timer cycle. As far as
the 6502 is concerned it only executed 6 cycles, but because its external
clock was slowed down, the wall-clock time taken is 10 2MHz ticks.

This example shows three stretches. Remember that all the time, the timer itself is
counting down too, so unless the emulation models the exact cycle within the
instruction that the reads and writes happen, the timer value will not be
updated properly. Kevin also uses the fact that when timers overrun interrupts
are generated to make the code even more difficult to emulate. In some cases,
writing to the timers will suppress or cancel pending interrupts, so subtle
timing differences can cause wildly different interrupt behaviour too.

Implementation details
----------------------

 [jsbeeb][] implements all the complex behaviour by "compiling" instructions from a
table of opcode side effects and knowledge of what addressing modes cause what
kinds of memory accesses. A list of cycles where memory accesses is kept, and
then an optimization pass is made: any memory accesses that are known not to
refer to any hardware devices (and thus don't have any sensitive time
dependencies or side effects) are coalesced where possible. Sequences of
CPU cycles with no hardware visible effects are also coalesced so that the
various state machines (like timers, video, sound etc) can be run for as long
a stretch as possible. Running them all a single cycle at a time is somewhat
inefficient.

For memory accesses that can't be optimized in this way, code is generated to
check for 1MHz bus accesses and appropriately sync the CPU clock.

The code for this is in the `InstructionGen` class in [6502.opcodes.js][opcodes].

Let's look at `INC Abs,X` from earlier. The compilation starts at
`getInstruction` which is given the text of opcode and its arguments. It calls
`getOp` with the opcode part (`INC`) and that returns a struct describing what
the instruction does (its `op`) and what bus cycles are needed (`read` and/or
`write`). In this case the operation needs both a read and write bus cycle, 
 and the op is the javascript snippet:

    :::javascript
    REG = (REG + 1) & 0xff;
    cpu.setzn(REG);

The `cpu.setzn` part sets the zero and negative processor flags according to
its argument. `REG` here is a variable that will contain the read-in value
from the read bus cycle and will be also be the value written out in the write
cycle.

Next `getInstruction` gets together the addressing mode part, by parsing the
opcode arguments `abs,x` [^2]. Now the instruction starts being put together. In
the following code snippets I've removed some `if` checks (describing them
instead), and also have shortened the lines to fit here. Check the [source on
github][opcodes] for full details.

First the 16-bit address is fetched from the two bytes at the current program
counter. Then the indexed address is calculated, along with a non-carried version. We
account for the three cycles this takes (to fetch the opcode byte, and then
the two bytes of the address):

    :::javascript
    ig = new InstructionGen();
    ig.append("addr = cpu.getw();");
    ig.append("addrWithCarry = addr + cpu.x;");
    ig.append("addrNonCarry = (addr&0xff00) 
                | (addrWithCarry&0xff);");
    ig.tick(3);

Next we perform the operation's required bus accesses. In our case we need a
read and a write. Here we account for the spurious read and write. 
The `readOp` and `writeOp` methods of the `InstructionGen` are
responsible for ticking the CPU the appropriate amount of time depending on
cycle stretching.

    :::javascript
    if (op.read && op.write) { // read/modify/write
      // First a spurious read of the non-carried address
      ig.readOp("addrNonCarry");
      // Now the actual read
      ig.readOp("addrWithCarry", "REG");
      // And a write of the unmodified value
      ig.writeOp("addrWithCarry", "REG");
    }

Now we apply the operation and write back the final result.

    :::javascript
    ig.append(op.op);
    if (op.write)
      ig.writeOp("addrWithCarry", "REG");

The final code is the result of calling `render` on the `InstructionGen`,
which does all the timer magic.

The final compiled code for `INC Abs,X` comes out as something like:[^3]

    :::javascript
    addr = cpu.getw();
    addrWithCarry = (addr + cpu.x) & 0xffff;
    addrNonCarry = (addr&0xff00) 
        | (addrWithCarry&0xff);
    cpu.polltime(4+cpu.is1MHzAccess(addrNonCarry) 
        * ((cpu.cycles & 1) + 1));
    cpu.readmem(addrNonCarry);
    cpu.polltime(1+cpu.is1MHzAccess(addrWithCarry) 
        * (!(cpu.cycles & 1) + 1));
    REG = cpu.readmem(addrWithCarry);
    cpu.polltime(1+cpu.is1MHzAccess(addrWithCarry) 
        * (!(cpu.cycles & 1) + 1));
    cpu.checkInt();
    cpu.writemem(addrWithCarry, REG);
    REG = (REG + 1) & 0xff;
    cpu.setzn(REG);
    cpu.polltime(1+cpu.is1MHzAccess(addrWithCarry) 
        * (!(cpu.cycles & 1) + 1));
    cpu.writemem(addrWithCarry, REG);
 
To get the actual version, fire up [jsbeeb][] and type `instructions6502[0xfe]` into the 
Javascript console.

[^2]: The code uses lowercase throughout although I've used more usual capitalization in this write-up. Sorry for any confusion!
[^3]: As I look at the generated code I realise I could make it a bit more efficient and readable. I'll look at updating that later so hopefully by the time you take the trouble to look it will be much nicer.

Next time I'll cover how the 6502 deals with interrupts and how that interacts
with the pipelining. I'll also cover one of the more common sources of
interrupts: the 6522 Versatile Interface Adapter's timers.
