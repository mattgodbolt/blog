Seasocks - a quick and easy websocket server in C++

Summary: Drawing attention to an open source project of mine
Label: Coding

I'd like to draw attention to an open-source library that I open
sourced a while ago: [Seasocks][].

[Seasocks][] is a simple-to-use, lightweight, embeddable C++ library that
implements HTTP and websockets. It has a simple way of serving static content
and even some dynamic content, but its main raison d'Ãªtre is for
websocket-based command and control.

[Seasocks]: https://github.com/mattgodbolt/seasocks "A simple, embeddable, C++ HTTP and Websocket library"

It has no external library dependencies, and only requires C++11 features such
as GCC 4.7 and above and Clang 3.4 already support.

Serving static files is as simple as:

    :::cpp
    void serve() {
        Server server(make_shared<PrintfLogger>();
        server.serve("web", 9090);
    }

Websockets are a little more involved, but not a whole deal more. He's the
skeleton of a chat client that simply broadcasts any input from a client to
all other connected parties.

    :::cpp
    struct ChatHandler : WebSocket::Handler {
        set<WebSocket *> connections;
        void onConnect(WebSocket *socket) override
        { connections.insert(socket); }
        void onData(WebSocket *, const char *data) override
        { for (auto c : connections) c->send(data); }
        void onDisconnect(WebSocket *socket) override
        { connections.erase(socket); }
    };

    void chat() {
        Server server(make_shared<PrintfLogger>());
        server.addWebSocketHandler(
            "/chat", make_shared<ChatHandler>());
        server.serve("web", 9090);
    }

There are more [examples][] in the [source][Seasocks].

There are other websocket libraries for C++ out there, but Seasocks has been
the workhorse of [our][work] C++ command and control for over four years now and has
proven to be a pretty reliable bit of software.
