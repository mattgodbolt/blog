Summary: More compilers!
Label: Coding

Bit late to mention it here, but [GCC Explorer](http://gcc.godbolt.org)
now supports GCC 5.1, and in fact has done since the day it was released!

GCC 5.1 has a bunch of link-time optimizations that aren't
well-demonstrated by GCC Explorer, so I'm going to have to revamp it a
little.  Watch this space!
