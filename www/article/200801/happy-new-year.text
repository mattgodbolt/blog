Status: Public

This year we celebrated the annual celebration of the arbitrary calendar overflow in Reading.
During the day we visited my Uni mate Nick and his wife Angela, where I was presented by the
best birthday present I've had in ages:

It's a cross-stich of an [xkcd][] cartoon, and a fantastic surprise --- doubly unexpected given that my
birthday is in August!  Thanks guys, this will be adorning my desk at work.

After this flying visit, we went out with another Uni friend, [Pierre][], and his girlfriend, Liz.
Pierre's a keen pilot and they had kindly invited
us along to their [local flying club][wlac]'s New Year's Eve bash.  We had an absolutely fantastic time.
Shame we're back to work today!
