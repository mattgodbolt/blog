Announcing new compilers for GCC Explorer
Date: 2015-02-09 05:00:00
Status: Draft
Summary: Yup, more compilers
Label: Coding

I'm very pleased to announce that [GCC Explorer](http://gcc.godbolt.org) now
supports some new compilers, and new architectures:

* [x86 GCC 4.8.2](http://goo.gl/nEgijt)
* [x86 Clang 3.5](http://goo.gl/D4uhgp)
* [Power PC GCC 4.8](http://goo.gl/ohLiRl)
* [ARM gcc 4.8](http://goo.gl/0RjZVx)
* [ARM64 gcc 4.8.2](http://goo.gl/zD2L6o)

It's been a long process to get here: keeping all the old Ubuntu 12.04
compilers but supporting these newer ones on Ubuntu 14.04 was tricky. I ended
up using a 12.04 [Docker](http://docker.io) image (after [much pain][blog])
and then [adding support][sup] to passing through to other GCC explorer
instances.

I hope to add more compilers soon. Next on my hitlist is GCC 4.9.2 and a
GCC 5.0 snapshot.  I'll update here when I do.
