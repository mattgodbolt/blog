Summary: Yup, even more compilers
Label: Coding, Compiler Explorer

As promised in the [last post](/201502/gcc-explorer-new-compilers) I've added
GCC 4.9.2 to [GCC explorer][ge]. Also new is clang 3.5.1 and experimental builds of
clang 3.6, and clang 3.7 -- all for x86.

[ge]: http://gcc.godbolt.org/

I meant to do a GCC 5.0 snapshot but I haven't gotten around to that yet;
hopefully later in the week I'll have time.
