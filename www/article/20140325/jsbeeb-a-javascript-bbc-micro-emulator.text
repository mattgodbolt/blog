Summary: Announcing a Javascript BBC Model B Microcomputer emulator
Label: Coding

Those not following me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/mattgodbolt) or
[Google+](https://plus.google.com/+MattGodbolt) won't have noticed that over the last few weeks
I've been working feverishly on my latest Javascript emulator.

So I'd like to announce [jsbeeb](http://bbc.godbolt.org) -- a Javascript BBC Micro emulator, currently targetting only
the BBC Model B (with sideways RAM).  It runs well in Chrome, fairly well in Firefox, and almost certainly
won't work on any other browser.

Games and other discs are available from the [Stairway to Hell](http://www.stairwaytohell.com/) archive and there's
support for loading games directly -- click the "Load from STH" button.

My pal Rich Talbot-Watkins is helping me get the instruction timings perfect so we can load some of the more gnarly
protection systems of old, but for now you can enjoy playing classics like:

  * [Repton](http://bbc.godbolt.org/?disc=%7CSuperior%2FRepton.zip&autoboot)
  * [Elite](http://bbc.godbolt.org/?disc=elite.ssd&autoboot)
  * [Exile](http://bbc.godbolt.org/?disc=%7CSuperior%2FExile.zip&autoboot)
  * [Thrust](http://bbc.godbolt.org/?disc=%7CSuperior%2FThrust.zip&autoboot)

...and many many more!

I now need to spend some time working on my [goto; conference](http://gotocon.com) [presentation](http://gotocon.com/chicago-2014/presentation/x86%20Internals%20for%20Fun%20and%20Profit) which is getting pretty scarily close now!
