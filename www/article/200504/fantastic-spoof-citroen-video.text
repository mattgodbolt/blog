Those extremely talented chaps over at [X-Bam][xbam] have been up to no
good with this hilarious <a href="/media/2CV.wmv">spoof
Citroen ad</a>.  It's a genius spin on the current <a
href="http://www.citroen.co.uk/">Citroen</a> ad running on European TV!

Update: Rumour has it the spoof has made it as far as the people who do
Citroen's web site!

Update 2: Citroen themselves have asked for the logos to be removed --- this
version is now the 'legally ok' version!  Top kudos to them for allowing it!

Update 3: Alex Mallinson, the brains behind the 2CV anim, has teamed up with his
brother to create <a href="http://www.diecastfilms.co.uk/">Die Cast Films</a>
--- definitely worth visiting for more stunning and hilarious videos!!
